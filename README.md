# reconnection
Work done at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab as an intern. Visualization of 2D dataset showing reconnection in a magnetic field.

The dataset used was taken from a 3D particle-in-cell simulation created to investigate the reconnection of magnetic fields in space.

The visualization created shows the xz-plane cross-sectional profiles of the plasma density in the simulation of a solar flare.

Matplotlib was used to create each frame, and then the frames were connected together with FFmpeg.
